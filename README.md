# chicago_movies_EDA
The purpose of this project was to build an application with interactive visualizations. This project looked at a Chicago Movies in the park dataset provided on Kaggle. The data was collected for the years 2014-2019 and includes dates, locations, ratings and titles of the movies. The dataset was cleaned in Jupyter notebook and then converted into a SQLite database. A flask backend was built and queries were run against the database to help build the visualizations. Using an HTML and javascript, a bar chart showed the top movies filtered for each month this event was run. The sunburst chart used the same filter and displayed the days of the week and year most common for the movies to be shown. The map took the ratings and displayed them by frequency to help determine which locations played the most family friendly movies. A static HTML about us and sources pages were also built. These were all displayed to a website where anyone can access the information. Using these visualizations, the user can gain some information on the best locations and days movies are available.
